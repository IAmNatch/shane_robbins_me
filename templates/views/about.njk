            <h2>What I do</h2>
            <p>From natural language processing to complex frontend animation, I'm constantly amazed by today's technological ecosystem. Although I'm a firm beleiver in using reliable, battle tested software, I love to experiment and search for new tools and workflows that increase productivity and make new projects do more for less. I tend to write software within the Node.js ecosystem, but ultimately would rather use the right tool over the tool I like. </p>
